"""engram MCP server — wraps the CLI commands as MCP tools.

Every tool maps 1:1 to a ``Memory`` method. No business logic
lives here; if a tool needs behavior the SDK doesn't have, the
method goes in ``Memory`` first.

Run with::

    python -m engram.mcp_server

or attach to Claude Code::

    claude mcp add engram -- python -m engram.mcp_server

Config, in priority order:

1. Per-tool-call argument (``project`` / ``db`` passed to the tool).
2. Environment variable (``ENGRAM_PROJECT`` / ``ENGRAM_DB``).
3. Built-in defaults (``"default"`` and ``~/.engram/default.db``).

**Note on the default DB path:** it is NOT ``~/.vstash/memory.db``
on purpose. The MCP server opens its own isolated engram store so
a buggy decider can't corrupt your main vstash. To attach engram
to your real vstash from Claude Code, pass
``db=~/.vstash/memory.db`` on the first tool call or set
``ENGRAM_DB=~/.vstash/memory.db`` before starting the server.

Silt's rule, carried across tools: *"before proposing an
algorithm, look at the distribution of the data."* This server
is the thinnest possible wrapper — no algorithms, no heuristics,
no hidden defaults. Every decision a tool call makes is
implemented in the engram SDK and audit-logged there.
